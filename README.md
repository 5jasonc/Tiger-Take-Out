Tiger Take Out

Market Research

Our user application is an online food delivery service, designed for RIT students. Dining Services could use this application to allow online orders from any student, on or off campus, at one of the many on-campus dining locations, or off campus locations which take Tiger Bucks. Students use Dining Dollars or Tiger Bucks to order the food they want, from the place they want, and have it delivered right to them. The application is simple, a student logs in with their student account, browses for the location they want to order from, selects their order, enters delivery and payment information, then waits. Relevant delivery information would be things like the student’s address, email, and payment option. Although many alternatives for food delivery exist, even ones like GrubHub or Uber Eats, who will deliver from many of different restaurants, no service exists for RIT specific dining locations. Since convenience can be an important factor for many busy or exhausted students, this could be an application that would introduce a useful service to many RIT students. We also created a survey for our fellow students to get real audience feedback for the concept and details of our application, and the results (despite our small sample size) point to people being interested in the concept, and the different restaurants we included seemed to correlate to what people would order. Overall, this application could have a useful purpose, and has strong audience appeal.

Task Management

To keep track of development we used GitHub and each worked in our own branch. Since the different parts of the project didn’t need to interact until the end of development, we used a development and master branch to organize progress. This allowed us to finish our assigned parts and merge with the development branch when ready. Seeing who committed to what branch and when allows us to keep track of who is completed with what, and when would be a good time to merge. Having the development branch lets us collaboratively work on our parts together in the end and complete the final product, and make sure everything works together smoothly. The master branch is finally used when we have a quality final product we are ready to push, and until that happens we can the development branch to see what things still need to be completed. We also used google docs to plan out the structure of our project, and what tasks would need to be done, before any code was written. This let us stay on track as we checked off certain goals.

Order of development:

Page mockups -> stylized pages ->  merge to get a working development branch -> integrating pages -> finishing touches -> finished product to push to master

Order of a run through the program:
Login -> restaurant selection -> order selection -> checkout & enter delivery information -> track order

User Experience

After testing our program and getting user feedback, it’s clear the application completes its purpose well, is user friendly, and satisfies the needs of our target audience. As far as usability, the interface is clean, the design and color scheme of each page is consistent, all the text and buttons are readable, and it is easy to use and understand the program, even without any context before using it. In terms of the application’s purpose, we set out to create a food delivery app for locations that accept Tiger Bucks. Our final product allows a user to log in and find what they want to eat, and lets them enter the correct information to have it delivered to them, as well as giving them updates as their order is prepared. For anyone with a student account and Tiger Bucks, this application allows them to order some decent food, from a real restaurant, and have it delivered right to them. It’s the perfect convenience for students and is designed to cater specifically to that specific audience. Even the survey we gave to students agrees, and most of our sample students only ordered about two food items, from one of a few kinds of locations (Grill/BBQ, Chinese/Asian, Pizza, etc.), most of which, we had an equivalent to in our application. Our program allows a user to do what the average (sample) RIT student would need to use the application for, and that’s exactly our target audience. Even our color scheme seems to align with what our sample students selected in the survey. The purpose of the application appeals to the target audience and works as needed.

Above and Beyond

We sent out a survey to a small group of other RIT students to answer a few questions related to our application. The questions were mostly gauging interest in the concept and details of the program. We constructed graphs to display the information, and used the opinions of our target audience to see how our application compares. Overall, it seems our program would fare well, and is something most students are interested in, at least, most of the students who took our survey.
